--- Intended Functions: ---
 - Anonymous user observation submission
    - following function of current form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RLbbL-EzLnnHgtZ5QSXPZHbnWbVE5V6Uhs8sm8-9MNQ/edit?ts=6351b3ea
 - Review of submission by experts:
    - "Reviewer methods: We have between 2-4 experts review each observation and categorize it. 
        If there is consensus on the category than thats what it is. If there is any disagreement, 
        reviews discuss their thought process. If this leads to consensus great. If there is still 
        disagreement the least definitive category is used (AKA 2 instead of 1, or 3 instead of 4)."
    - This could be in admin panel
 - List view displaying all observations and statuses
    - This could be in admin panel
 - Admin panel for Dave/Steph to edit anything else
    - permissions for everything except what normal reviewers use
